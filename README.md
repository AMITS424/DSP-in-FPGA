# DSP-in-FPGA
Signal processing algorithm like FFT can be easily implemented in FPGA as I did in Xilinx 14.7 ISE. The main advantage of FPGA lies in its flexibility but its cost is its main disadvantage which is recently coming down. In future we can expect FPGA will have major role not only in academia and industry as well as in all parts of life.
